 Project 7-NLP Project for Disaster Tweet Classification

Project Summary:
The project revolves around developing an automated system for real-time disaster detection on Twitter, leveraging machine learning techniques. In today's digital era, social media platforms serve as vital channels for disseminating information during emergencies. However, discerning genuine disaster-related tweets amidst the noise of unrelated content poses a significant challenge. Hence, the project aims to create a robust classification model capable of accurately identifying tweets related to real disasters.

Business Needs:
Timely Disaster Detection: Enable timely detection of disasters by monitoring social media platforms like Twitter, allowing for prompt response and assistance deployment.
Risk Mitigation: Mitigate risks associated with false alarms and misinformation by accurately identifying genuine disaster-related tweets and filtering out noise.
Enhanced Situational Awareness: Provide disaster relief agencies, news outlets, and relevant stakeholders with real-time insights into unfolding emergencies for informed decision-making.
Resource Optimization: Optimize resource allocation and response strategies by prioritizing and addressing verified disaster alerts effectively.
Public Safety: Contribute to public safety by facilitating rapid dissemination of accurate information during emergencies, thereby enhancing community resilience and preparedness.
